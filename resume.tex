    \textbf{Indian Railways Application} \vspace{2mm}\\\vspace{1mm}%
    \textsl{Developer} \hfill \textbf{January 2017}\\
    Developed an Android Application in Java that lets users get live information about their ticket, train status/schedule, seat availability, and more. The application is not official and has not been released in the app store. I created the application to learn about android development, REST APIs, and material design.

    \begin{itemize}
    \item Implemented OkHttp to make network requests to a REST API. Used Card Views to display the information, making the UI compact and more appealing.
    \item Implemented train name/number and station code autocomplete. Here, the application sends requests to a REST API containing the partial information the user has put in, and displays a list of trains/stations with matching information to choose from.
    \item Used material design principles to create a clean and simple UI.
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Indian Blood Banks Application}\vspace{2mm}\\\vspace{1mm}%
    \textsl{Developer} \hfill \textbf{December 2016}\\
    Created an Android Application in Java that lets users find blood banks by district or state. The application contains information for 2900+ blood banks, and provides address, contact information, and more. The application is not official and has not yet been released in the app store. I developed the application to learn about SQLite databases.

    \begin{itemize}
    \item Retrieved the blood banks information from the Indian Open Government Data Platform. Created an SQLite database using the information, and made a simple application that queries data from that SQLite database.
    \item Created spinners with state and district names for making queries. Since the number of districts was quite large (around 700), and manually inputting the district names to a string-array for the spinners seemed tedious, I wrote a function in Java that took the district names as csv and returned them as items in a string-array.
    \item Used material design principles to create a clean and simple UI.
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Personal Website}\vspace{2mm}\\\vspace{1mm}%
    \textsl{Developer, manaspande.com} \hfill \textbf{December 2016}\\
    Created a personal website to link to my GitHub, e-mail, and resume. Made the website responsive using CSS flexbox, and used FontAwesome for the icons.
